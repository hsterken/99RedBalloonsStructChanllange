//Start by creating a struct to model a Balloon. The Balloon should know it's number and what image it has. Next, create a function that creates 99 balloons and randomly assigns one of the 4 images to the created Balloon instance. Use a switch statement to assign each of the four Balloon images. Add these all to an array property in the ViewController.

struct balloon {
    
    var index = 0
    var image : UIImage = UIImage(named: "")
    
    
}
